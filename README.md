# misc-org-scripts
Some python scripts I use for file organization and creative pursuits 

**copy_all_of_type** takes an input folder, a file type, and an output folder and copies all files of given type from the input to one combined folder. useful for extracting all audio stems from a given project for repackaging and backing up for a reformat

**ebsynth_sort** is a derivative of the copy script but meant specifically for setting up environments for using [ebsynth](https://ebsynth.com/). moves all files to given folder but also seperates key frames of a given period (ie every 25 frames) to a seperate folder nearby

**replace_space** replaces all the space characters in every file in the scripts directory. useful for cleaning up terribly named assets
